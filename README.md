# Tracking Flight Prices on Kayak
Final Project for Projects in Programming and Data Science (Fall 2018) by Amy Chen, Jonathan Lin, Nicole Ng and Valerie Wang

We created a website that tracks flight prices from New York City to 10 popular cities in the United States over time, with the goal of identifying any pricing patterns and the best time to buy a flight ticket. Data was scraped from [Kayak.com](kayak.com) so that we could also test the accuracy of Kayak's price prediction tool. 

The website is hosted on a virtual machine in Google Cloud Platform: [here](http://35.243.212.161:5000/)
